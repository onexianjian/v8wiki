A portion of JavaScript built-in functions such as Array.prototype.sort is implemented in JavaScript themselves. They can be found in files located in src/js. However, part of these implementations cannot be expressed in JavaScript, and are handled by C++ code that we call "runtime functions". These runtime functions are called with their names prefixed by %.

Usually, these runtime functions are limited to V8 internal JavaScript code. For debugging purposes, they can also be called from normal JavaScript code if V8 is run with the flag --allow-natives-syntax. Some runtime functions are embedded directly by the compiler into generated code.
